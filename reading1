## Story 4: How Plants Grow
**Genre: Non-fiction/Science**

Plants are living things that grow all around us. They need four important things to grow: sunlight, water, air, and soil. Without these things, plants cannot live.

First, a tiny seed is planted in the soil. The seed needs water to start growing. Slowly, a small root grows down into the ground. Then a green shoot grows up toward the sun. The shoot becomes a stem with leaves.

Plants make their own food using sunlight! This is called photosynthesis. The leaves catch sunlight and use it to make food for the plant. As the plant grows bigger, it may make flowers. Flowers can turn into fruits with new seeds inside. Then the cycle starts again!
